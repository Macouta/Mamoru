### Computer graphics

#### [three graces](cg/three-graces)

Three graces is one of my first experimentation with Blender. I tried to create something with a good composition, it has to be a triptic of three squares. I discovered the texture node editor and mess around with it to denaturate those feminine figures with vivid and saturated colors.

#### [mercenary](cg/mercenary)

I try to recreate the mercenary character from the game Risk Of Rain 2.  
I did the modeling, the painted textures, and rigging/posing.
